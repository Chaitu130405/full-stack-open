# [Full Stack Open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This course is held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2020.

It serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course also covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data. A part on TypeScript can also be found on this year's edition.
