# Phonebook

In this exercise, we created a simple phonebook.

In this phonebook, users have the possibility to a add a new person as well as its phone number. Person's names are unique, which means that users cannot add names that already exist in the phonebook.

A search field is also available in the app to filter the people by their name

## Start the application

To start an application, do the following :

```bash
$ yarn start
```

You can then access the app on : [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
